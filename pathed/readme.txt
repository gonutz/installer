Pathed is a command-line tool for editing the Windows path in the registry. Help
is included within the program itself.

The program was developed using Code::Blocks and the TDM/MinGW g++ compiler. There is
a Code::Blocks project file and an independant Makefile, both of which should (I hope)
do more or less the same thing.
